# Data-Visualization

## Summary
This project explored the titanic dataset provided by Udacity for creating an story in Tableau. The dataset contains the details of the people who were onborad that ship. It lists their gender, their class, age, name, passenger id, fare, cabin, survived or not, etc. 

The dataset when loaded into the software needed changes in terms of data types. For example, age was a continuous variable which was changed to discrete. Similarly, we changed the data types of pclass, survived, parch ect according to the requirement. Additionally, 'Age[bin]' was created to make the graph look nice and more understandable.

First plot shows the average fare amongst the gender for survivors as well as dead ones and with mmore number of females, the avearge is higher for women. Also, if we add class to the plot. we can see that maximum contribution is coming from the 1st class female passengers.

Next plot shows the survior count by ages of people falling in 10-35 Yrs. Clearly we can see from the graph that more men had died than women which is due to the preference that women gets in such situations. 

Third plot shows the plot of survivors with class and we can see now that 300 men of 3rd class had died which is the highest and is expected as well as poor tends to suffer maximum.

The plot that follows the previous one shows the fare distribution with class. By looking at it, we can access the reasons for higher fare of women. The average fare for surviveed women is 105.98 in comparison with 74.64 for men of first class while dead, the figures are 110.60 and 62.89 respectively. for other classes amount is too low to stand for camparison. This also shows the gap between the rich and poor in the society.
Next two plots shows the survivors count by class with gender and class with fare. By adding trend lines, we see that for 3rd class passengers, a strong relationship exists with survivors count.
